  You have to follow the style of the rest of the code even if you 
  don't like it.  The code style is K&R with 8 space tabs.

*Roadmap

  *) src/fr-process.c : A class that lets you execute commands in 
     sequence.  You can define a command as sticky if you want that it must
     be executed even if a previous command has failed.

  *) src/fr-command.c : An abstract class used as base to define archiving
     utilities interfaces.  For example fr-command-tar.c implements an 
     interface for the tar command.  FRCommands use a FRProcess object to
     execute commands.

  *) src/fr-archive.c : A class that implements the archive concept.  An
     FRArchive object can load any archive type of which there is a
     corrisponding FRCommand interface.  It adds high level operations as
     add_with_wildcard, add_directory, and implements options not supported
     by the archiving utility.  For example,  you can extract files from a
     tar archive without recreating the path even if the tar command does not
     support this feature.  If an option is supported natively the command 
     line option is used.

  *) src/window.c : Implements the window object.

  *) src/dlg-*.c : All files starting with dlg- implement a dialog.
